# IRC setup for poker playing; last revised 6 June 1995
#
# IMPORTANT:
# Known to work under ircII version 2.2.9 (type /version in IRC to check).
#
# Lines like this one beginning with "#" are comments ignored by irc.
# This file, after you edit it, should be named .ircrc (note the leading
# period) in your home directory so that irc will automatically load it.
# The only thing you have to edit is your password just below.  You might
# also want to edit the initial defaults for beeping, just a little more
# below.

# Edit the password.  The password is used by the pwait (be put on waiting
# list when game is full) and play (start playing) commands.

assign password moe

# The following two commands affect whether your terminal will beep
# when you receive a private message.

alias msgloud ^assign msgBeep 1
alias msgquiet ^assign msgBeep 0

# Whichever of the two following lines does NOT have a "#" is the default:
msgloud
#msgquiet

# The following two commands affect whether your terminal will beep
# when it is your turn to act.

alias actloud ^assign actBeep 1
alias actquiet ^assign actBeep 0

# Whichever of the two following lines does NOT have a "#" is the default:
actloud
#actquiet

# Displays last raiser, hole cards, board cards, pot size, and number of
# players in hand on terminal status line; provides irc commands that send
# messages directly to the poker server which require no parsing by the
# client and which do not appear on other players' terminals.  You can
# play irc poker without using this file or one like it, but a poker
# .ircrc makes playing MUCH easier!

# irc is the internet chat/talk system with provision for automatons
# ("bots") to provide various services.  The poker server uses irc to deal
# real-time poker games to internet users.  At this writing one or more
# poker games are available -- i.e., have several people playing -- almost
# all the time except (usually) some portions of the morning (USA time).
# Texas Hold 'Em is currently the most popular game, followed by Omaha
# Hi-Low Split.  There are also freeze-out tournaments going on a
# fairly regular basis.
#
# To connect to the irc poker server, use the following shell command:
#              irc your_nickname 128.2.198.36
# where your_nickname is replaced by the unique name by which you wish
# to be known to other poker players.  It cannot be longer than 9
# characters (and preferably shorter than that).  If you use a name
# that is already taken, the poker server will ask you for another.
#
# If you're new to irc and want to learn the basics or more about it,
# note that it has an extensive on-line help facility; enter /help
# for its help menu.

# The maintainer of the poker server software is:
#                    Todd W. Mummert
#                  <mummert+@cs.cmu.edu>
# The file you're reading is due to various authors.  At the date
# shown above, it is maintained by maurer@nova.stanford.edu, but he
# claims no credit for the good stuff here.

# What this file provides is the definition of custom irc commands
# by use of the irc alias command.
# EVERY COMMAND DEFINED HEREIN MUST BE ENTERED WITH A LEADING
# SLASH ("/") WHEN YOU TYPE IT AT YOUR TERMINAL.
# Commands are defined in the form:
# alias command definition_of_command
# You type /command to enter the command.  In some cases you follow
# the command with arguments, e.g., in a pot-limit game: /raise 100
# Anything you type without a leading "/" is shown on the terminal
# of everyone else on the irc channel.  So if you have questions
# about the mechanics of the game, just ask and someone will likely
# answer.

# Summary of frequently-used commands.  Commands NOT defined in this
# script file, i.e., built-in irc commands, are shown with "##" in
# the left margin.
#

# Tournament information and historical statistics.  Each of the commands
# in this section is really a command to Michael Maurer's tournament
# observer automaton.  Each except /tstatus will work only if you are on

# (currently, /tourney or /tomaha):
#   /tstatus <name_of_channel>  Show status of tournament on specified channel
#                               --leading "#" in channel name is optional;
#                               --channel is remembered for subsequent use
#                                 with following version until you go to
#                                 another channel with a "go to game" command
#   /tstatus                    Channel defaults from a previous /tstatus
#                               command; otherwise it's the current channel.
#   /tlineup                    Shows rankings of players in the current
#                               tournament.  Works like /tstatus.
#   /tstats                     Show your tournament history statistics
#   /tstats <nick>              Show statistics for player <nick>
#   /ttop3 [sched]              Show top winners as if percentage payout
#                                 to top finishers (default 50 30 20)
#   Each of the following commands can be followed by a number
#   indicating the number of players to be shown; the default is 10:
#   /ttopp                      Show top players by power rating
#   /ttop                       Show top tournament money winners

#                                 default for min is 20 tournaments
#   /ttop4                      Show top winners as if 2nd place wins 1 buy-in
#   /tdregs                     Show "worst players of all time"
# Private messages:
##  /msg <nickname_of_user> <text_of_msg>
##  /msg , <text_of_msg>        To user who last sent you a /msg
##  /msg . <text_of_msg>        To user to whom you last sent a /msg
#   /msgloud                    Beep on receipt of private message (default)
#   /msgquiet                   Don't beep on receipt of private message
# Combination commands affecting beeps:
#   /loud                       Combination of actloud and msgloud commands
#   /quiet                      Combination of actquiet and msgquiet commands
# To quit playing (If playing, ALWAYS use before leaving or signing off):
#   /pquit                      Quit the game
#   /iquit                      Quit the game and reset status line
# To leave the game (channel) you're attending:
##  /leave *
# To sign off irc (quit the irc client process), either of:
##  /quit
##  /signoff

# Following are commands to go to the various games -- in irc terms,
# channels on which games are played.  They do not cause you to join the
# game, as you might want to first watch for a while.  To join a game, use
# the play command defined further below.  When you join a game for the
# first time, you are given a bankroll of $1000 in limit games and $5000 in
# pot/no limit. If you go broke, just rejoin the game and you'll get another
# bankroll (and a bankruptcy recorded in your statistics).  The money is, of
# course, entirely virtual.  The only reward for winning is to one's ego --
# this is aided by various rankings and statistics kept by the poker server.

# YOU MUST USE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS (example: /holdem) TO GO
# TO THE CHANNEL (GAME) IN ORDER FOR THE OTHER STUFF HERE TO WORK.  DO
# NOT USE THE IRC /JOIN COMMAND TO GO TO A POKER GAME.  ONCE ON A CHANNEL,
# START PLAYING BY ENTERING THE COMMAND: /play

# The lineup of available games may change from time to time.  To create
# a command to go to a new game, define a new command in the following
# form, where you replace <angle bracket items> with the appropriate
# word:
#
# alias <new_command> go_game <channel_name> <dealer/bot_name>
#
# Use the /list command to see the games currently available.  Use
# the command /who <channel_name> to see who is on a given channel,
# including the name of the dealer/bot for that channel.

alias holdem1 go_game #holdem1 HBot1

# Tournaments are special kinds of games.  Each player starts with the
# same size bankroll.  The blinds double periodically.  A player who goes
# broke is eliminated -- cannot play any longer in the current
# tournament.  The tournament is over when one player has won all of
# the money.  You must join a tournament (enter the /play command)
# before the start of the tournament.

alias tourney go_game #tourney TBot
alias ptourney go_game #ptourney PTBot
alias tomaha go_game #tomaha OTBot

# To see what games are being played, enter the irc command /list
# Subtract at least 1 from the number of Users listed to
# get actual players, as the count shown includes at least the
# dealer ("bot") which is a not a real person and may include
# people (or computer programs!) who are just watching.

# Redefine p to send a private message to the poker server, bypassing
# client parsing:
alias p quote privmsg $bot :p

# Following are the poker commands.  You can set up local keyboard
# macros to issue these commands (with a leading "/").  Or if you're stuck
# with having to type, you can create new aliases with shorter command names.
# For example, you could remove the "#" from the following line...
# alias ch check
# and then enter /ch when you want to check.  To avoid conflict with
# built-in commands, aliases you define should be at least two letters
# long.  The order in which you define your aliases with respect to
# other aliases used in their definition doesn't matter, since the
# defined commands are not evaluated until they are used.

# The various action commands can be issued in advance of your turn to
# act.  If you change your mind before action reaches you, issue the
# undo command.

alias undo p undo
alias check p check
alias fold p fold

# The call command can be followed by an amount.  If no amount is
# provided, it means call whatever the bet is to you.  If you include
# an amount, it means call up to the specified amount, or else fold
# if the bet to you is larger.  Thus, for example, you can decide in
# advance how many raises (if any) you're willing to call in a limit
# game.  If you're the big blind, you could enter "call 0" to check if
# there are no raises or to fold otherwise.

alias call p call

# Three raises are allowed per round, except:  no player is denied the
# opportunity to make at least one raise, and when two players remain
# there is  no limit on number of raises.

alias raise p raise

# Note that the poker bot doesn't understand "bet" in the sense of
# an opening bet; it knows only raises (from 0) when you're first to act
# or it's checked to you. Thus we define a bet command:

alias bet p raise

# In pot- or no-limit games, the bet or raise commands can be followed by
# an amount (e.g., "raise 100").  In pot-limit games, the commands can be
# followed by the word "pot" to raise the maximum, which is the size of
# the pot after calling the outstanding bet, if any:

# Raise the maximum in a pot-limit game:

alias rpot raise pot

# The make command is used in no- or pot-limit games to bet or raise
# an amount such that the total bet to a player who hasn't yet acted
# is a certain amount.  E.g, if it's $50 to you and you "/make 125"
# that's equivalent to "/raise 75".

alias make p make

# Show the current status of the game (players, bankrolls, button
# position, who's folded, etc.).  Bankrolls and position are shown
# automatically at the start of each hand; this command is typically
# used during a hand -- perhaps by someone who just arrived, to see
# how many people on the channel are actually playing:

alias status p status

# Deal a new game. In dealer's choice, can be followed by a game number
# (see games command further below).  Otherwise it is not usually used
# explicitly (see autodeal command further below):
alias deal p deal

# For use in pot- or no-limit -- bet/raise the minimum amount,
# i.e., the amount of the previous bet or raise, or if no betting
# yet on this round then the amount of the last blind.

alias rmin p raise $min_raise

# The following two commands would be needed only if your terminal
# doesn't provide a status line.  They display, respectively, your
# hole cards and the up-cards on the board:

alias cards p cards
alias board p board

# Send a canned reminder message to the player whose turn it is:

alias remind p remind

# kik nick removes the player with nickname nick from the game.  Used
# when a player seems to have disappeared.  The poker bot will wait
# forever for a player to act, even if the player has been disconnected
# or has signed off (without first quitting the game).  Spelling avoids
# conflict with irc kick command:

alias kik p kick

# The following shows you how you're doing relative to other players:

alias rank p rank

# The following two provide statistics for the top-ranked players:

alias top p top
alias top2 p top2

# Keep all of your cards (stand pat) in a draw game:

alias pat p toss

# Specify which cards to discard/replace in a draw game -- follow with
# the cards (e.g., Js 4c 3h) you want to replace:

alias draw p toss

# What game am I playing?  --Useful in dealer's choice:

alias game p game

# What games are available? --Useful in dealer's choice; shows game
# numbers for use with the deal command.  Spelling avoids conflict
# with irc list command:

alias games p list

# Join a game:

alias play p join $password

# Join a game (usually a tournament) from another channel.  The /seatme
# command must be followed by the name of the dealer/bot for the game to
# be joined.  Tournament entries have a limited time window, since you
# can join only after a previous tournament has ended and before the
# one you want to enter begins.  You can use /tstatus <name_of_channel>
# while on another channel to check the status of a tournament in
# progress.  When the the status is "no tournament in progress" you
# can enter /seatme <name_of_dealer/bot> to quickly enter the next
# tournament.  If you sense there's no rush, however, you can just
# go to the tournament channel (currently, with /tourney or /tomaha)
# and then enter the /play command.

alias seatme quote privmsg $0 :p join $password

# Get on the waiting list for a game that is currently full.  The
# leading "p" avoids conflict with the irc wait command:

alias pwait p wait $password

# Take yourself off the waiting list:

alias unwait p unwait

# Change your waiting list password (follow command with new password):

alias password p password

# Quit a game.  If you're in a game, please issue one of the following
# two commands before leaving the channel. The spellings avoid conflict
# with the irc quit command, which unceremoniously quits the irc
# program:

alias pquit p quit

# Note:  to quit and show a reason, enter "p quit <reason>" (without
# a slash).  E.g., enter "p quit brb" for a bathroom break.

# Quit a game and reset your terminal status line to normal non-poker
# format.

alias iquit doquit

# Display the poker server's current help file.  At this writing
# it consists only of a list of commands.  The spelling avoids
# conflict with the irc help command:
alias phelp p help

# You might want to edit the part after "say" to suit your taste:

alias time say Time, please. <thinking...>

# or you can just enter something like "hmm..." (without a slash).

# autodeal automatically generates a deal command after the end of
# each game.  noautodeal cancels such generation.  For typical play
# in games other than dealer's choice at least one player should enter
# the autodeal command.  However, generation of autodeal is
# automatic in this script file for all games except dealer's choice
# unless you issue /noautodeal.

alias autodeal ^assign auto_deal 1
alias noautodeal ^assign -auto_deal

# The following commands affect whether your terminal will beep on
# both private messages and your turn to act.  They are a short-hand
# for a combination the actloud + msgloud or actquiet + msgquiet commands:

alias loud actloud msgloud
alias quiet actquiet msgquiet

# Following are tournament control commands.  See the command summary
# near the start of this file.

alias blind p blind
alias double p double
alias bankroll p bankroll
alias start p start
alias vacation p vacation
alias back p back

# Here are special commands for Chinese Poker.
alias byrank p byrank
alias bysuit p bysuit
alias back p back
alias middle p middle
alias front p front
alias setting p setting
alias stakes p stakes
alias pset p set
alias punset p unset
alias surr p surrender
alias surrender p surrender
#alias call p call
